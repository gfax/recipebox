h3. Peppers

Warning: remember that peppers burn people differently, so your results may vary.
* "Jalape単o":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalape%C3%B1o - Tasty and essential. Mild pepper with a quick burn. If this is the only pepper you're adding, leave half the seeds for some warmth, all the seeds for some burn.
* "Cayenne":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayenne_pepper - Quick, heavy burn. Use sparingly.
* "Habanero":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsicum_chinense Habanero - Fruity with a slow pungent burn. The intensity of flavor and burn increases in this order: dark red (habanero chiles), orange, bright red (Scotch Bonnet, Trinidad Scorpion, etc). Goes well with a jalape単o. Use no seeds from the jalape単o or habanero for some burn. Leave half the seeds from the jalape単o and habanero for real burn. Leave all the seeds from both if you are serious about life.
