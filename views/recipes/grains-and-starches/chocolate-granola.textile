# Pre-heat oven to 350F/175C.
# In a large mixing bowl, combine oats, almonds, and flax seeds.
# Mix oil, honey, cinnamon, cardamom, vanilla extract, and salt in a small bowl, then drizzle over oat mix.
# Bake in a large pan for 10 minutes. Add cranberries and stir mixture. Bake an additional 5 minutes.
# If using coconut, add just a few minutes before removal.
# Return granola to mixing bowl and slowly add chocolate while stirring to avoid the chocolate melting into clumps.
# Once cooled to room temperature, store in an airtight container. Refrigerate for extended freshness.
