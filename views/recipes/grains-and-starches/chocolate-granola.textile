* 18 oz rolled oats
* 3 oz almonds, toasted and chopped
* 2 oz pepitas, toasted and chopped
* 1/2 oz flax seeds, toasted
* 3 Tbsp canola oil or coconut oil
* 1 Tbsp honey
* 3/4 tsp cardamom
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg optional
* 1/4 tsp anise (optional)
* 1/4 tsp cloves (optional)
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/8 tsp salt or to taste
* 1/4-1/3 cup dried cranberries (or other dried fruits)
* 1/4 cup shredded coconut (optional)
* ~2.5 oz dark chocolate

# Pre-heat oven to 350F/175C.
# In a large mixing bowl, combine oats, almonds, pepitas, and flax seeds.
# Mix oil and spices in a small bowl. Drizzle and stir into oat mix.
# Bake in a large pan for 10 minutes. Add cranberries and stir mixture. Bake an additional 5 minutes.
# Return granola to mixing bowl and slowly add chocolate in pieces while stirring to avoid the chocolate melting into clumps. If using coconut, stir in at this point.
# Once cooled to room temperature, store in an airtight container. Refrigerate for extended freshness.
