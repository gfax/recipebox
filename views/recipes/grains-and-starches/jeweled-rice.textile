* 2 cups basmati rice, cooked and rinsed cold
* 2 oranges, juiced and zested
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 medium carrots, peeled, cut into matchstick-size pieces
* 1/4 cup dried barberries or 1/2 cup dried cranberries, soaked and drained
* 1/4 cup raisins, soaked and drained
* 1/4 cup non-salted pistachios, toasted and slivered
* 1/4 cup almonds, toasted and slivered
* 1/4 tsp saffron threads
* 1/4 cup hot water (for saffron)
* 2 Tbsp ghee or unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup olive oil, divided
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped
* 1/8 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1/4 tsp ground cumin
* 1/4 tsp ground turmeric

# In a pan, bring orange juice, zest, sugar, and water to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Add carrots, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until carrots are tender. Drain and set aside, discarding syrup.
# Place saffron in a small bowl and add the hot water. Set aside.
# In a large pot, heat ghee and 1 Tbsp of the oil in a large skillet. Add onion, salt, and cook until soft and brown. Add cardamom, cumin, turmeric, and 1 tablespoon of the saffron water. Cook until fragrant.
# Reduce heat to low. Add berries and nuts. Cook about 3 minutes.
# Add rice, remaining saffron water, remaining oil and stir. Poke 5–6 holes in rice all the way through to bottom of pot (to help release steam and cook rice evenly). Cover with a tight-fitting lid.
# Cook until pot begins to steam. Reduce heat to very low and cook, without removing lid, for 30 minutes. Break up rice in the bottom of the pot before serving.
