# Blend crust ingredients together in a food processor until completely mixed. Press and roll the crust into the bottom of a 9-inch pan, about 1/4 inch thick.
# In a food processor, add cashews, maple syrup, water and salt for the filling. Mix until smooth. Add cocoa powder, hazelnut butter and coconut oil to the mixture and blend them all together until mixture is uniformly combined. 
# Spoon or pipe filling on top of the crust and smooth off the top as necessary. Stick the pie in the freezer for 2-4 hours or until solid all the way through. 
# Once frozen, slowly remove pie from pan. In a food processor, mix sauce ingredients and spread on top of pie.
# Optionally, top with (vegan) chocolate shavings or crushed and toasted hazelnuts before the sauce solidifies.
