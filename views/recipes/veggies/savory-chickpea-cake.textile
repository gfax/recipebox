h2. Savory Chickpea Cakes

*Cake mix:*
* 2 (15 oz) cans of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1/2 cup green onions, chopped
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/4 tsp rosemary
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 lemon, juice and zest
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/4 cup breadcrumbs 
* 1/4 cup sesame seeds, toasted
*For frying:*
* ~5 Tbsp olive or canola oil
* salt to taste

# Combine cake ingredients in food processor. Mix until uniform, but firm enough to hold together.
# Add 2 Tbsp of the oil to a frying pan and heat. Form mix into 3-to-4-inch-wide patties. Do not make too thick or the cakes won't cook through.
# Cook cakes until golden-brown on each side, about 3 minutes each, adding more oil as necessary. Move finished patties to a rack or paper towel to rest and cool.
