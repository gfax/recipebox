h2. Chicken Cacciatore

* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 1/4 tsp salt
* 3/4 tsp black pepper
* 3 1/2 to 4 lbs chicken, cut into pieces
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped
* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 celery stalk, diced
* 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 3 sprigs fresh thyme
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 (28 oz) can plum tomatoes
* 1/3 cup dry red wine
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped

# In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper. Rinse the chicken and pat it dry with paper towels. Working in batches, lightly coat the chicken with the flour mixture, shaking off any excess.
# Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium heat. Add some of the chicken to the pan and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate; set aside. Repeat with the remaining chicken.
# Add the onion to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add the carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes.
# Crush the tomatoes in the can with a large spoon and stir them into the vegetables along with the wine and the remaining salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer. Add the chicken, reduce heat, and cover. Simmer for 45 minutes, turning the pieces occasionally. Remove and discard the bay leaf. Stir in the parsley.
